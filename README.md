Hi there! ðŸ’ªðŸ©·
Our beloved cat, Leo, has been diagnosed with Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), a rare and often fatal viral disease that affects cats. FIP causes severe inflammation within the cat's body, particularly in the abdominal and neurological systems, and without immediate treatment, it can quickly become life-threatening.

FIP is caused by a mutation of the feline coronavirus. Though not contagious to humans or other animals, FIP is fatal without proper medical intervention. Symptoms can vary widely but often include fever, lethargy, loss of appetite, and fluid buildup in the abdomen. Fortunately, recent advancements in veterinary medicine have introduced antiviral treatments that can cure FIP if caught early.

The treatment for FIP requires an antiviral drug that, while highly effective, is costly and must be administered for several weeks. This treatment, along with continuous veterinary care, diagnostic tests, and ongoing monitoring, is expensive. The total cost for Leo's treatment, including medication and medical bills, is much higher than we can afford.

To help fund Leoâ€™s treatment and ongoing care, weâ€™ve launched a campaign called **Pixels for Paws**. Instead of asking for donations directly, weâ€™re offering an innovative way for businesses to advertise while supporting Leoâ€™s fight against FIP.

On our website, weâ€™ve divided a digital canvas into thousands of small pixels, each available for purchase as a unique advertising space. By purchasing a pixel, businesses not only promote their brand but also contribute to Leoâ€™s medical expenses. Each pixel represents a small step towards saving Leoâ€™s life, and your support makes a world of difference.

We believe in a win-win approach: businesses can promote their products and services, while at the same time, they are helping to save a life. Since the treatment for FIP is costly, we cannot afford to provide this platform for free. By purchasing advertising space on our website, you are investing in both your brand and a noble cause.

Our goal is to raise enough money to cover Leoâ€™s full treatment and provide him with the care he needs to recover fully. Every pixel sold directly contributes to Leoâ€™s medical bills, so your support is truly invaluable.

We are incredibly grateful for any support, whether itâ€™s purchasing a pixel, sharing our campaign, or spreading the word. Together, we can give Leo the chance he deserves to fight this disease and live a long, healthy life. Thank you for being part of this journey.
